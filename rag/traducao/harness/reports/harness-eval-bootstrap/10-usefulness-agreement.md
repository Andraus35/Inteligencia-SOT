# Harness Eval: Usefulness Agreement (Track C)

> Run dir: `/workspace/Inteligencia-SOT/rag/traducao/.harness-eval/runs/bootstrap`
> Trap gate: PASS (misses=0)
> Fan-in gate: PASS (slim-fanin-blocked=0)
> Judges: J1 model=`codex-gpt-6-inherited (exact API model id not exposed)` · J2 model=`codex-gpt-6-inherited (exact API model id not exposed)`
> Bands: Slim = dual SLIM/ROUTING + trap PASS + fan-in PASS; Keep-core = dual KEEP-CORE; Mixed = dual MIXED; Hold = disagree / unclear / missing / slim-fanin-blocked
> **Model-sensitive:** re-judge on a second model before large Slim deletes.
> **Fan-in:** another harness surface hard-loads this path as SoT → Hold, not Slim.
> **Mixed apply:** use `11-mixed-apply.md` only — do not re-judge from this table alone.

## What these words mean

| Word | Meaning | You should |
|------|---------|------------|
| **Keep-core** | Most of the file changes agent behavior | Do **not** slim |
| **Mixed** | Real rules + large theory/examples/overlap | Keep rules; cut bulk — follow `11-mixed-apply.md` |
| **Slim** | Mostly theory / repo-demo / overlap, **and** no other harness surface hard-loads it | Compress or delete body |
| **Hold** | Judges disagreed, unclear, or Slim blocked by fan-in | Do nothing yet (or update consumers first) |
| **Trap PASS** | Planted traps scored correctly | Necessary but not sufficient for Slim |
| **Fan-in blocked** | Another harness file mandates loading this path / treats it as SoT | Do **not** stub/delete until consumers are updated |

This track answers: *does deleting this change agent behavior?* Not the same as redundancy (`07-agreement.md`).

## Executive summary

- Real surfaces scored: 2
- Slim: **0**
- Keep-core: **2**
- Mixed: **0** → apply plan: `11-mixed-apply.md`
- Hold: **0** (fan-in blocked: 0)
- Trap misses: none

## Discrimination (plants)

Slim by tier: {}
Keep-core by tier: {'T0': 1, 'T1': 1}
Mixed by tier: {}
Hold by tier: {}

## Slim (compress / delete body candidates)

| ID | Tier | Name | Path | J1 | J2 |
|----|------|------|------|----|----|

## Slim fan-in blocked (do not stub/delete)

Dual SLIM/ROUTING-ONLY, but another harness surface hard-loads the path (load/SoT/extract mandate). Update or drop those consumers before Slim apply.

| ID | Path | Citers |
|----|------|--------|
| — | — | none |

## Keep-core

| ID | Tier | Name | Path | J1 | J2 |
|----|------|------|------|----|----|
| S001 | T0 | AGENTS.md | `AGENTS.md` | KEEP-CORE | KEEP-CORE |
| S002 | T1 | translation-quality | `.agents/skills/translation-quality/SKILL.md` | KEEP-CORE | KEEP-CORE |

## Mixed (keep core, slim examples/theory)

Path list only. **Apply instructions:** `11-mixed-apply.md` (KEEP/CUT per ID).

| ID | Tier | Name | Path | J1 | J2 |

## Hold

## Action guidance

- **Slim:** compress only after trap PASS **and** fan-in PASS; still human-approve; prefer re-judge on a second model if deleting >30% of a skill.
- **Slim fan-in blocked:** do **not** stub/delete; either keep the checklist body or update every citing harness surface in the same change, then re-merge.
- **Mixed:** open `11-mixed-apply.md` and execute KEEP/CUT per ID only. Do **not** re-judge. Do **not** replace KEEP snippets with `See app/...` or defer KEEP contracts to AGENTS.md. Empty Keep-core/Slim cells → skip that path.
- **Keep-core:** do not slim for usefulness reasons.
- **Hold:** no usefulness trim.
